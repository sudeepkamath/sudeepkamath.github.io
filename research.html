<h1>Sudeep Kamath &ndash; Research</h1>
</div>
<p>I am broadly interested in information theory, statistics, and
learning. My research as outlined in more detail below, has focused on
the interplay between these disciplines. Below are my research themes.</p>
<h2>Learning Distributions</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Understanding how fast we can learn an unknown probability
distribution from its samples, and the corresponding optimal
estimators is a fundamental problem in learning theory. Surprisingly,
this was understood only for one approximation measure: the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy). We studied this
problem under other important notions of loss, specifically <img class="eq" src="src/eqs/2349274112114421517-130.png" alt="ell_1" style="vertical-align: -3px" />
distance, chi-squared divergence, and general f-divergence
approximation measures.</p>

<h2>Strong Data Processing Inequalities</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>An elementary result in information theory asserts that data
processing cannot increase the amount of information. In other words,
if the random variables <i>U-X-Y</i> form a Markov chain, then the
information that the data <i>X</i> provides about <i>U</i> will be no smaller
than the information that the processed data <i>Y</i> provides about
<i>U</i>. In many cases, this inequality can be strengthened quantitatively
to identify how much information is precisely lost. Such so-called
strong data processing inequalities have played an important role in
recent years in diverse areas such as stochastic simulation, error
correcting codes, computation in circuits with noisy gates, and
distributed statistical estimation.</p>
<p>Our work has focused on studying connections to hypercontractivity,
and on studying mutual information between Boolean functions. A recent
application was a simple information-theoretic proof of a
beautiful result in probability theory due to Dembo, Kagan, and Shepp
(2001) that characterized the maximal correlation of sums of
i.i.d. random variables.</p>

<h2>Network Information Theory</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="pics/directed_cutset_picture.jpg" alt="Directed Cutset bound" width="405px" height="386px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>Network information theory aims to characterize the information
capacity of a general multi-flow noisy network. This goal has proven
to be considerably difficult, even for small networks. The most
general upper bound on the information capacity known was the cutset
bound due to El Gamal (1981). We provide a new upper bound on the
information capacity that is the first improvement over the classical
cutset bound. Our bound has a simple form involving the <i>directed
information</i>, a temporal concept that was introduced by Marko and
Massey (1990) to study communication under feedback. We thus, provide
a <i>spatial interpretation</i> to the directed information. Our bound is
represented pictorially on the left.</p>

<h2>Commodity Flow, Network Capacity, and Approximation Algorithms</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>We developed the Generalized Network Sharing bound, a new outer bound
for wireline (or graphical) networks, which we proved to be close to
tight in several cases of network or traffic symmetry. We showed that
the seemingly simple two-unicast problem (the problem of communication
in a network with two sources and two destinations, each source
communicating a message to its own destination) is as difficult as the
general multiple-unicast problem, which was known to be hard. For
single-unicast delay-constrained networks, we showed that the
advantage of coding was bounded by a factor logarithmic in the delay
constraint, by studying a new traffic pattern that we called
trianglecast and adapting to it a rounding algorithm in the form of a
region-growing lemma.</p>
